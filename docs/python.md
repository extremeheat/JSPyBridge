# Docs for bridge to call JavaSript from Python

(See README.md for some additional details)

* All function calls to JavaScript are thread synchronous
* ES6 classes can be constructed without new
* ES5 classes can be constructed with the .new psuedo method
* Use `@On` decorator when binding event listeners. Use `off` to disable it.
* All callbacks run on a dedicated callback thread. DO NOT BLOCK in a callback or all other events will be blocked. Instead:
* Use the @AsyncTask decorator when you need to spawn a new thread for an async JS task.


## Built-ins

Dependencies are automatically maanged through the library through the `require` function. If
you run into issues with dependencies, you can clear the internal `node_modules` folder cache
by using `python3 -m javascript clear` in a command line.

### imports

```py
def require ( package_name: str, package_version: Optional[str] = None ) -> Void
```

* `package_name` : The name of the npm package you want to import. If you use a relative import
  (starting with . or /) then it will load the file relative to where your calling script is.
* `package_version` : The version of the npm package you want to install. If blank, first try to
  require from the local or global npm registry. If not found, install the specified package name
  and version. These two combine to create a unique ID, for example `chalk--1.0`. This ensures two
  different versiond don't collide. This parameter is ignored for relative imports.

### threads

This library provides some wrappers around threads. You aren't forced to use them, but they
help you avoid boilerplate and are simple to use.

```py
from javascript import AsyncTask, start, stop, abort
@AsyncTask(start=True)
def routine(task: TaskState):
  ...

# The signatures for the above functions :
def start(fn: Function): ...
def stop(fn: Function): ...
def abort(fn: Function, killAfterSeconds: Optional[Int]): ...
class TaskState:
  sleeping: bool
  def wait(seconds: Int): ...
  sleep = wait # Sleep is an alias to wait.
```

The AsyncTask decorator is a wrapper for creating threads. Any function you wrap with it will
result in the creation of a thread, bound to the specified function. It will *not* automatically
start the thread, unless `start` parameter is set to True. 

The `start()`, `stop()` and `abort()` functions all relate to AsyncTask threads. If you didn't
already start a AsyncTask, you can programmatically start it later with `start(routine)`. If you
want a thread to stop, you can send a `stopping` signal to it. The first parameter to all AsyncTasks
is a `TaskState` object. That object has a `stopping` variable, and a `wait` function. The stopping
variable indicates that the thread should exit immediately, and it's your responsibility to make
sure it does. The `wait` function that exists in TaskState will sleep, but also automatically exit 
the process once the `stopping` flag is True. 

```py
import time
from javascript import AsyncTask, start, stop, abort
@AsyncTask(start=False)
def routine(task: TaskState):
  while not task.stopping: # You can also just do `while True` as long as you use task.sleep and not time.sleep
    ... do some repeated task ...
    task.sleep(1) # Sleep for a bit to not block everything else

start(routine)
time.sleep(1)
stop(routine)
```

If you need to be 100% sure the thread has stopped, you can use `abort(fn, seconds)` function instead. This
will kill the thread if it doesn't kill in n seconds. It's not good pratice to kill Python threads, so
avoid this when possible. To avoid trouble, `stop()` does not force the thread to exit, it just asks.

### events

This library provides some wrappers around EventEmitters. You must use them over the built-in
`.on`, `.off` and `.once` methods of normal EventEmitters. You can still use `.emit` normally.

These wrappers are avaliable as `@On(emitter, eventName)`, `@Once(emitter, eventName)` and
the top-level `off(emitter, eventName, handlerFn)` function.

```py
from javascript import require, On, Once, off
MyEmitter = require('./emitter.js')
# New class instance
myEmitter = MyEmitter()
# Decorator usage
@On(myEmitter, 'increment')
def handleIncrement(this, counter):
    print("Incremented", counter)
    # Stop listening. `this` is the this variable in JS.
    off(myEmitter, 'increment', handleIncrement)
# Trigger the event handler
myEmitter.inc()
```
